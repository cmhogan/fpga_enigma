# fpga_enigma.pcf — iCE40-HX8K Breakout Board (CT256) pin constraints
# UART signal names are from the iCE40's perspective:
#   uart_tx = iCE40 transmits  (connected to FTDI Channel B RXD, pin B10)
#   uart_rx = iCE40 receives   (connected to FTDI Channel B TXD, pin B12)

# 12 MHz oscillator
set_io clk       J3

# External reset (active-low)
set_io ext_rst_n R9

# UART (iCE40 perspective, directly to FTDI Channel B)
set_io uart_tx   B10
set_io uart_rx   B12

# LEDs (active-high accent LEDs on HX8K Breakout Board)
set_io led_d1    B5
set_io led_d2    B4
set_io led_d3    A2
set_io led_d4    A1
set_io led_d5    C5
